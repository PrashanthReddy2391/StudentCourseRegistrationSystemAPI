This repository Only contains the APIs for the needed functionalities mentioned.The Api routes can be seen in routes/api.php.
The Models created as representative of Students and Courses Data table.This Demo is built on Xampp Server using laravel version 7.3,MYSQL,PHP 7.2


The API  URLs are as follows :

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/retrieveStudentsInfoByCourseId/{id}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/retrieveAllCoursesAvailable
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/retrieveStudentTableInfoByCourseId/{id}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/createCourse
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/modifyCourse/{id}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/modifyCourse/{id}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/retrieveAllStudentsEnrolledData
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/retrieveStudentDataToStudent/{id}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/modifyStudent/{id}
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/addStudentToCourse/{id}

We have seeders defined for both course and student table and is connected to php Mysql .

The Courses and students table share a has many relationship.Here I defined the model as course_Id in student table as a
foreign key that references the id on the course table.

Also attempted at adding JWT token based authentication for the APIs as well.
